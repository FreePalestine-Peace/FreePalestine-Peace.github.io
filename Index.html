      <h3 id="Title3"> Peaceful Resolutions for the Palestine-Israel Conflict and The Importance Protecting The Lives of the Innocent</h3>
      <article> Regardless of who is holds claim to the land of Palestine-Israel, As tensions arise between both countries 
             it is important we continue to express the importance of protecting innocent
              lives to parties who are willing to sacrifice it in order to gain claim over worldy benefit
              . In order to do so, it is important to consider and present potential solutions to the conflict. 
              The Israel-Palestine Conflict is a longstanding dispute over the land, with both sides claiming 
              legitimate ownership. The Jewish people claim the land based on their religious connections and
               previous occupancy, while the Muslim people claim it based on their religious connection and 
               occupancy of the land for the past 10 centuries. Despite this, it is important to focus on 
               finding a solution to prevent further loss of life, rather than continuing to debate the 
               ownership of the land.One potential solution is to draw on past native vs settler conflicts 
               and their solutions, as well as current solutions presented by experts in the media. 
               By combining this knowledge with internal and external perspectives, it may be possible 
               to construct a solution to the conflict. Another potential solution to the conflict between 
               Israel and Palestine is the two-state solution, which would involve the creation of an independent
                Palestinian state alongside the state of Israel. Similarly, the option of one-state
                 solution, which would involve the creation of a single, bi-national state with equal rights
                  and representation for Israelis and Palestinians can also be implemented. My final suggested approach would be 
                   the use of international mediation and peacekeeping forces to help facilitate negotiations
                    and provide security in the region. Ultimately, finding a solution to the conflict will 
                    require willingness from both sides to compromise and work towards peace 
                  <br>Regardless of the possible solutions brought to the table, the most important and difficult objective is answering the question of how we can approach the willingness to compromise.Much of the current situation of the Israel-Palestine conflict can be associated with past Native vs Settler conflicts from around the world, and in doing so we can presume possible leeway to compromise to the quarrel. It is also important that as we take in an understanding of the solutions to past native vs settler conflicts we also implement current solutions presented by dedicated individuals in mass media. Finally with a combination of an understanding of past native-Settler conflicts, presented solutions by mass media and internal-external perspectives, we can construct possible solutions to the quarrel.The difficult question about how, the Israel-Palestine conflict can be resolved is one that, seemingly has no answer, and by no means do I believe the one I give is going to be the best possible solution, but I am giving it in hopes of leading the readers of this writing into the correct direction. With an understanding of Mitchell Thomas’s perspective on settlers and their arrogance, Trevor Noah's resolution involving the lowering of arms, for the country that remains dominant, or the breaking of the loop presented by Baranovich, Nadia. I believe that the only way to truly resolve the conflict is to deepen our connections as humans rather than our differences as people. The difference in religion plays such a huge role in the conflict that it is almost impossible to continue while maintaining peace with the differences associated with it in mind.
                  Through Trevor Noah's speech, I was able to learn the importance of superiority in an aspect, and the motive to keep the peace when in power. I believe that the idea that, retaliation when 
                  contributed to the power you hold should have differed from its original track deepening my belief in the solution to the conflict. Through Mitchell Thomas’s work understanding the mass correlations made to the settlers of land made, was important also when understanding how the correlated traits can be resolved. And through Nadia's work, I was able to learn the importance of the loop of hatred and grief and how it can truly be ended.
                  I hope this writing makes it to those who wish to support peace within the land of Palestine and Israel, I also wish that this writing can be associated with the idea of Neve Shalome, a village in which Muslims and Jews coexist, and see religion as a personal belief rather than a difference. I hope this writing is read by the people of Palestine and Israel and saves a life that could have been potentially lost in conflict.
